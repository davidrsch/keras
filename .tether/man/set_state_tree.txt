keras.Model.set_state_tree(self, state_tree)
__doc__
Assigns values to variables of the model.

This method takes a dictionary of nested variable values, which
represents the state tree of the model, and assigns them to the
corresponding variables of the model. The dictionary keys represent the
variable names (e.g., `'trainable_variables'`, `'optimizer_variables'`),
and the values are nested dictionaries containing the variable
paths and their corresponding values.

Args:
    state_tree: A dictionary representing the state tree of the model.
        The keys are the variable names, and the values are nested
        dictionaries representing the variable paths and their values.
