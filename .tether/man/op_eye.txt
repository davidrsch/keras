Args:
    N: Number of rows in the output.
    M: Number of columns in the output. If `None`, defaults to `N`.
    k: Index of the diagonal: 0 (the default) refers to the main
        diagonal, a positive value refers to an upper diagonal,
        and a negative value to a lower diagonal.
    dtype: Data type of the returned tensor.

Returns:
    Tensor with ones on the k-th diagonal and zeros elsewhere.
