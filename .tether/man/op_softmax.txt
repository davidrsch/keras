keras.ops.softmax(x, axis=-1)
__doc__
Softmax activation function.

The elements of the output vector lie within the range `(0, 1)`, and their
total sum is exactly 1 (excluding the floating point rounding error).

Each vector is processed independently. The `axis` argument specifies the
axis along which the function is applied within the input.

It is defined as:
`f(x) = exp(x) / sum(exp(x))`

Args:
    x: Input tensor.
    axis: Integer, axis along which the softmax is applied.

Returns:
    A tensor with the same shape as `x`.

Example:

>>> x = np.array([-1., 0., 1.])
>>> x_softmax = keras.ops.softmax(x)
>>> print(x_softmax)
array([0.09003057, 0.24472847, 0.66524096], shape=(3,), dtype=float64)
