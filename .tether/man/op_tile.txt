keras.ops.tile(x, repeats)
__doc__
Repeat `x` the number of times given by `repeats`.

If `repeats` has length `d`, the result will have dimension of
`max(d, x.ndim)`.

If `x.ndim < d`, `x` is promoted to be d-dimensional by prepending
new axes.

If `x.ndim > d`, `repeats` is promoted to `x.ndim` by prepending 1's to it.

Args:
    x: Input tensor.
    repeats: The number of repetitions of `x` along each axis.

Returns:
    The tiled output tensor.
