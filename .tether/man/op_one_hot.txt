__doc__
Converts integer tensor `x` into a one-hot tensor.

The one-hot encoding is a representation where each integer value is
converted into a binary vector with a length equal to `num_classes`,
and the index corresponding to the integer value is marked as 1, while
all other indices are marked as 0.

Args:
    x: Integer tensor to be encoded. The shape can be
        arbitrary, but the dtype should be integer.
    num_classes: Number of classes for the one-hot encoding.
    axis: Axis along which the encoding is performed. Defaults to
        `-1`, which represents the last axis.
    dtype: (Optional) Data type of the output tensor. If not
        provided, it defaults to the default data type of the backend.
    sparse: Whether to return a sparse tensor; for backends that support
        sparse tensors.

Returns:
    Integer tensor: One-hot encoded tensor with the same shape as `x`
    except for the specified `axis` dimension, which will have
    a length of `num_classes`. The dtype of the output tensor
    is determined by `dtype` or the default data type of the backend.

Example:

>>> x = keras.ops.convert_to_tensor([1, 3, 2, 0])
>>> one_hot(x, num_classes=4)
array([[0. 1. 0. 0.]
       [0. 0. 0. 1.]
       [0. 0. 1. 0.]
       [1. 0. 0. 0.]], shape=(4, 4), dtype=float32)
