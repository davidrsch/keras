class Adamax(keras.src.optimizers.optimizer.Optimizer)
 |  Adamax(learning_rate=0.001, beta_1=0.9, beta_2=0.999, epsilon=1e-07, weight_decay=None, clipnorm=None, clipvalue=None, global_clipnorm=None, use_ema=False, ema_momentum=0.99, ema_overwrite_frequency=None, loss_scale_factor=None, gradient_accumulation_steps=None, name='adamax', **kwargs)
 |
 |  Optimizer that implements the Adamax algorithm.
 |
 |  Adamax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm, is a first-order
 |  gradient-based optimization method. Due to its capability of adjusting the
 |  learning rate based on data characteristics, it is suited to learn
 |  time-variant process, e.g., speech data with dynamically changed noise
 |  conditions. Default parameters follow those provided in the paper (see
 |  references below).
 |
 |  Initialization:
 |
 |  ```python
 |  m = 0  # Initialize initial 1st moment vector
 |  u = 0  # Initialize the exponentially weighted infinity norm
 |  t = 0  # Initialize timestep
 |  ```
 |
 |  The update rule for parameter `w` with gradient `g` is described at the end
 |  of section 7.1 of the paper (see the referenece section):
 |
 |  ```python
 |  t += 1
 |  m = beta1 * m + (1 - beta) * g
 |  u = max(beta2 * u, abs(g))
 |  current_lr = learning_rate / (1 - beta1 ** t)
 |  w = w - current_lr * m / (u + epsilon)
 |  ```
 |
 |  Args:
 |      learning_rate: A float, a
 |          `keras.optimizers.schedules.LearningRateSchedule` instance, or
 |          a callable that takes no arguments and returns the actual value to
 |          use. The learning rate. Defaults to `0.001`.
 |      beta_1: A float value or a constant float tensor. The exponential decay
 |          rate for the 1st moment estimates.
 |      beta_2: A float value or a constant float tensor. The exponential decay
 |          rate for the exponentially weighted infinity norm.
 |      epsilon: A small constant for numerical stability.
 |          name: String. The name to use
 |          for momentum accumulator weights created by
 |          the optimizer.
 |      weight_decay: Float. If set, weight decay is applied.
 |      clipnorm: Float. If set, the gradient of each weight is individually
 |          clipped so that its norm is no higher than this value.
 |      clipvalue: Float. If set, the gradient of each weight is clipped to be
 |          no higher than this value.
 |      global_clipnorm: Float. If set, the gradient of all weights is clipped
 |          so that their global norm is no higher than this value.
 |      use_ema: Boolean, defaults to `False`.
 |          If `True`, exponential moving average
 |          (EMA) is applied. EMA consists of computing an exponential moving
 |          average of the weights of the model (as the weight values change
 |          after each training batch), and periodically overwriting the
 |          weights with their moving average.
 |      ema_momentum: Float, defaults to 0.99. Only used if `use_ema=True`.
 |          This is the momentum to use when computing
 |          the EMA of the model's weights:
 |          `new_average = ema_momentum * old_average + (1 - ema_momentum) *
 |          current_variable_value`.
 |      ema_overwrite_frequency: Int or None, defaults to None. Only used if
 |          `use_ema=True`. Every `ema_overwrite_frequency` steps of iterations,
 |          we overwrite the model variable by its moving average.
 |          If None, the optimizer
 |          does not overwrite model variables in the middle of training,
 |          and you need to explicitly overwrite the variables
 |          at the end of training by calling
 |          `optimizer.finalize_variable_values()` (which updates the model
 |          variables in-place). When using the built-in `fit()` training loop,
 |          this happens automatically after the last epoch,
 |          and you don't need to do anything.
 |      loss_scale_factor: Float or `None`. If a float, the scale factor will
 |          be multiplied the loss before computing gradients, and the inverse
 |          of the scale factor will be multiplied by the gradients before
 |          updating variables. Useful for preventing underflow during
 |          mixed precision training. Alternately,
 |          `keras.optimizers.LossScaleOptimizer` will
 |          automatically set a loss scale factor.
 |      gradient_accumulation_steps: Int or `None`. If an int, model & optimizer
 |          variables will not be updated at every step; instead they will be
 |          updated every `gradient_accumulation_steps` steps, using the average
 |          value of the gradients since the last update. This is known as
 |          "gradient accumulation". This can be useful
 |          when your batch size is very small, in order to reduce gradient
 |          noise at each update step.
