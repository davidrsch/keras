)
__doc__
Return elements from `choicelist`, based on conditions in `condlist`.

Args:
    condlist: List of boolean tensors.
        The list of conditions which determine from which array
        in choicelist the output elements are taken.
        When multiple conditions are satisfied,
        the first one encountered in condlist is used.
    choicelist: List of tensors.
        The list of tensors from which the output elements are taken.
        This list has to be of the same length as `condlist`.
    defaults: Optional scalar value.
        The element inserted in the output
        when all conditions evaluate to `False`.

Returns:
    Tensor where the output at position `m` is the `m`-th element
    of the tensor in `choicelist` where the `m`-th element of the
    corresponding tensor in `condlist` is `True`.

Example:

```python
from keras import ops

x = ops.arange(6)
condlist = [x<3, x>3]
choicelist = [x, x**2]
ops.select(condlist, choicelist, 42)
# Returns: tensor([0,  1,  2, 42, 16, 25])
```
