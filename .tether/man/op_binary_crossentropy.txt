__doc__
Computes binary cross-entropy loss between target and output tensor.

The binary cross-entropy loss is commonly used in binary
classification tasks where each input sample belongs to one
of the two classes. It measures the dissimilarity between the
target and output probabilities or logits.

Args:
    target: The target tensor representing the true binary labels.
        Its shape should match the shape of the `output` tensor.
    output: The output tensor representing the predicted probabilities
        or logits. Its shape should match the shape of the
        `target` tensor.
    from_logits: (optional) Whether `output` is a tensor of logits or
        probabilities.
        Set it to `True` if `output` represents logits; otherwise,
        set it to `False` if `output` represents probabilities.
        Defaults to`False`.

Returns:
    Integer tensor: The computed binary cross-entropy loss between
    `target` and `output`.

Example:

>>> target = keras.ops.convert_to_tensor([0, 1, 1, 0])
>>> output = keras.ops.convert_to_tensor([0.1, 0.9, 0.8, 0.2])
>>> binary_crossentropy(target, output)
array([0.10536054 0.10536054 0.22314355 0.22314355],
      shape=(4,), dtype=float32)
