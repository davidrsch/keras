keras.ops.bitwise_left_shift(x, y)
__doc__
Shift the bits of an integer to the left.

Bits are shifted to the left by appending `y` 0s at the right of `x`.
Since the internal representation of numbers is in binary format, this
operation is equivalent to multiplying `x` by `2**y`.

Args:
    x: Input integer tensor.
    y: Input integer tensor.

Returns:
    Result tensor.
