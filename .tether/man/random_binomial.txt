Draw samples from a Binomial distribution.

The values are drawn from a Binomial distribution with
specified trial count and probability of success.

Args:
    shape: The shape of the random values to generate.
    counts: A number or array of numbers representing the
        number of trials. It must be broadcastable with `probabilities`.
    probabilities: A float or array of floats representing the
        probability of success of an individual event.
        It must be broadcastable with `counts`.
    dtype: Optional dtype of the tensor. Only floating point types are
        supported. If not specified, `keras.config.floatx()` is used,
        which defaults to `float32` unless you configured it otherwise (via
        `keras.config.set_floatx(float_dtype)`).
    seed: A Python integer or instance of
        `keras.random.SeedGenerator`.
        Used to make the behavior of the initializer
        deterministic. Note that an initializer seeded with an integer
        or None (unseeded) will produce the same random values
        across multiple calls. To get different random values
        across multiple calls, use as seed an instance
        of `keras.random.SeedGenerator`.
