)
__doc__
Loads an image into PIL format.

Example:

```python
image = keras.utils.load_img(image_path)
input_arr = keras.utils.img_to_array(image)
input_arr = np.array([input_arr])  # Convert single image to a batch.
predictions = model.predict(input_arr)
```

Args:
    path: Path to image file.
    color_mode: One of `"grayscale"`, `"rgb"`, `"rgba"`. Default: `"rgb"`.
        The desired image format.
    target_size: Either `None` (default to original size) or tuple of ints
        `(img_height, img_width)`.
    interpolation: Interpolation method used to resample the image if the
        target size is different from that of the loaded image. Supported
        methods are `"nearest"`, `"bilinear"`, and `"bicubic"`.
        If PIL version 1.1.3 or newer is installed, `"lanczos"`
        is also supported. If PIL version 3.4.0 or newer is installed,
        `"box"` and `"hamming"` are also
        supported. By default, `"nearest"` is used.
    keep_aspect_ratio: Boolean, whether to resize images to a target
        size without aspect ratio distortion. The image is cropped in
        the center with target aspect ratio before resizing.

Returns:
    A PIL Image instance.
