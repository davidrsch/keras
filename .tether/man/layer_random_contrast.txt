Help on class RandomContrast in module keras.src.layers.preprocessing.image_preprocessing.random_contrast:

class RandomContrast(keras.src.layers.preprocessing.image_preprocessing.base_image_preprocessing_layer.BaseImagePreprocessingLayer)
 |  RandomContrast(factor, value_range=(0, 255), seed=None, **kwargs)
 |
 |  A preprocessing layer which randomly adjusts contrast during training.
 |
 |  This layer will randomly adjust the contrast of an image or images
 |  by a random factor. Contrast is adjusted independently
 |  for each channel of each image during training.
 |
 |  For each channel, this layer computes the mean of the image pixels in the
 |  channel and then adjusts each component `x` of each pixel to
 |  `(x - mean) * contrast_factor + mean`.
 |
 |  Input pixel values can be of any range (e.g. `[0., 1.)` or `[0, 255]`) and
 |  in integer or floating point dtype.
 |  By default, the layer will output floats.
 |
 |  **Note:** This layer is safe to use inside a `tf.data` pipeline
 |  (independently of which backend you're using).
 |
 |  Input shape:
 |      3D (unbatched) or 4D (batched) tensor with shape:
 |      `(..., height, width, channels)`, in `"channels_last"` format.
 |
 |  Output shape:
 |      3D (unbatched) or 4D (batched) tensor with shape:
 |      `(..., height, width, channels)`, in `"channels_last"` format.
 |
 |  Args:
 |      factor: a positive float represented as fraction of value, or a tuple of
 |          size 2 representing lower and upper bound.
 |          When represented as a single float, lower = upper.
 |          The contrast factor will be randomly picked between
 |          `[1.0 - lower, 1.0 + upper]`. For any pixel x in the channel,
 |          the output will be `(x - mean) * factor + mean`
 |          where `mean` is the mean value of the channel.
 |      value_range: the range of values the incoming images will have.
 |          Represented as a two-number tuple written `[low, high]`. This is
 |          typically either `[0, 1]` or `[0, 255]` depending on how your
 |          preprocessing pipeline is set up.
 |      seed: Integer. Used to create a random seed.
