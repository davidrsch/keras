keras.saving.get_registered_object(
  name,

  module_objects=None
)
__doc__
Returns the class associated with `name` if it is registered with Keras.

This function is part of the Keras serialization and deserialization
framework. It maps strings to the objects associated with them for
serialization/deserialization.

Example:

```python
def from_config(cls, config, custom_objects=None):
    if 'my_custom_object_name' in config:
        config['hidden_cls'] = tf.keras.saving.get_registered_object(
            config['my_custom_object_name'], custom_objects=custom_objects)
```

Args:
    name: The name to look up.
    custom_objects: A dictionary of custom objects to look the name up in.
        Generally, custom_objects is provided by the user.
    module_objects: A dictionary of custom objects to look the name up in.
        Generally, module_objects is provided by midlevel library
        implementers.

Returns:
    An instantiable class associated with `name`, or `None` if no such class
        exists.
