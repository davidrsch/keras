Help on class Mean in module keras.src.metrics.reduction_metrics:

class Mean(keras.src.metrics.metric.Metric)
 |  Mean(name='mean', dtype=None)
 |
 |  Compute the (weighted) mean of the given values.
 |
 |  For example, if values is `[1, 3, 5, 7]` then the mean is 4.
 |  If `sample_weight` was specified as `[1, 1, 0, 0]` then the mean would be 2.
 |
 |  This metric creates two variables, `total` and `count`.
 |  The mean value returned is simply `total` divided by `count`.
 |
 |  Args:
 |      name: (Optional) string name of the metric instance.
 |      dtype: (Optional) data type of the metric result.
 |
 |  Example:
 |
 |  >>> m = Mean()
 |  >>> m.update_state([1, 3, 5, 7])
 |  >>> m.result()
 |  4.0
 |
 |  >>> m.reset_state()
 |  >>> m.update_state([1, 3, 5, 7], sample_weight=[1, 1, 0, 0])
 |  >>> m.result()
 |  2.0
 |  ```

 |  Methods defined here:
 |
 |  __init__(
 |    self,
 |    name='mean',
 |    dtype=None
 |  )
 |      Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
 |
 |  reset_state(self)
 |      Reset all of the metric state variables.
 |
 |      This function is called between epochs/steps,
 |      when a metric is evaluated during training.
 |
 |  result(self)
 |      Compute the current metric value.
 |
 |      Returns:
 |          A scalar tensor, or a dictionary of scalar tensors.
 |
 |  update_state(
 |    self,
 |    values,
 |    sample_weight=None
 |  )
 |      Accumulate statistics for the metric.
