)
__doc__
Test whether all array elements along a given axis evaluate to `True`.

Args:
    x: Input tensor.
    axis: An integer or tuple of integers that represent the axis along
        which a logical AND reduction is performed. The default
        (`axis=None`) is to perform a logical AND over all the dimensions
        of the input array. `axis` may be negative, in which case it counts
        for the last to the first axis.
    keepdims: If `True`, axes which are reduced are left in the result as
        dimensions with size one. With this option, the result will
        broadcast correctly against the input array. Defaults to `False`.

Returns:
    The tensor containing the logical AND reduction over the `axis`.

Examples:
>>> x = keras.ops.convert_to_tensor([True, False])
>>> keras.ops.all(x)
array(False, shape=(), dtype=bool)

>>> x = keras.ops.convert_to_tensor([[True, False], [True, True]])
>>> keras.ops.all(x, axis=0)
array([ True False], shape=(2,), dtype=bool)

`keepdims=True` outputs a tensor with dimensions reduced to one.
>>> x = keras.ops.convert_to_tensor([[True, False], [True, True]])
>>> keras.ops.all(x, keepdims=True)
array([[False]], shape=(1, 1), dtype=bool)
