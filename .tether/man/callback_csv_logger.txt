Help on class CSVLogger in module keras.src.callbacks.csv_logger:

class CSVLogger(keras.src.callbacks.callback.Callback)
 |  CSVLogger(filename, separator=',', append=False)
 |
 |  Callback that streams epoch results to a CSV file.
 |
 |  Supports all values that can be represented as a string,
 |  including 1D iterables such as `np.ndarray`.
 |
 |  Args:
 |      filename: Filename of the CSV file, e.g. `'run/log.csv'`.
 |      separator: String used to separate elements in the CSV file.
 |      append: Boolean. True: append if file exists (useful for continuing
 |          training). False: overwrite existing file.
 |
 |  Example:
 |
 |  ```python
 |  csv_logger = CSVLogger('training.log')
 |  model.fit(X_train, Y_train, callbacks=[csv_logger])
 |  ```

 |  Methods defined here:
 |
 |  __init__(self, filename, separator=',', append=False)
 |      Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
 |
 |  on_epoch_end(
 |    self,
 |    epoch,
 |    logs=None
 |  )
 |      Called at the end of an epoch.
 |
 |      Subclasses should override for any actions to run. This function should
 |      only be called during TRAIN mode.
 |
 |      Args:
 |          epoch: Integer, index of epoch.
 |          logs: Dict, metric results for this training epoch, and for the
 |            validation epoch if validation is performed. Validation result
 |            keys are prefixed with `val_`. For training epoch, the values of
 |            the `Model`'s metrics are returned. Example:
 |            `{'loss': 0.2, 'accuracy': 0.7}`.
 |
 |  on_train_begin(self, logs=None)
 |      Called at the beginning of training.
 |
 |      Subclasses should override for any actions to run.
 |
 |      Args:
 |          logs: Dict. Currently no data is passed to this argument for this
 |            method but that may change in the future.
 |
 |  on_train_end(self, logs=None)
 |      Called at the end of training.
 |
 |      Subclasses should override for any actions to run.
 |
 |      Args:
 |          logs: Dict. Currently the output of the last call to
 |            `on_epoch_end()` is passed to this argument for this method but
 |            that may change in the future.
