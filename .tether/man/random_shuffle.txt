keras.random.shuffle(

  seed=None
)
__doc__
Shuffle the elements of a tensor uniformly at random along an axis.

Args:
    x: The tensor to be shuffled.
    axis: An integer specifying the axis along which to shuffle. Defaults to
        `0`.
    seed: Optional Python integer or instance of
       `keras.random.SeedGenerator`.
        By default, the `seed` argument is `None`, and an internal global
        `keras.random.SeedGenerator` is used. The `seed` argument can be
        used to ensure deterministic (repeatable) random number generation.
        Note that passing an integer as the `seed` value will produce the
        same random values for each call. To generate different random
        values for repeated calls, an instance of
        `keras.random.SeedGenerator` must be provided as the `seed` value.
        Remark concerning the JAX backend: When tracing functions with the
        JAX backend the global `keras.random.SeedGenerator` is not
        supported. Therefore, during tracing the default value seed=None
        will produce an error, and a `seed` argument must be provided.
