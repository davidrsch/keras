  kth,
  axis=-1
)
__doc__
Performs an indirect partition along the given axis.

It returns an array
of indices of the same shape as `x` that index data along the given axis
in partitioned order.

Args:
    a: Array to sort.
    kth: Element index to partition by.
        The k-th element will be in its final sorted position and all
        smaller elements will be moved before it and all larger elements
        behind it. The order of all elements in the partitions is undefined.
        If provided with a sequence of k-th it will partition all of them
        into their sorted position at once.
    axis: Axis along which to sort. The default is -1 (the last axis).
        If `None`, the flattened array is used.

Returns:
    Array of indices that partition `x` along the specified `axis`.
