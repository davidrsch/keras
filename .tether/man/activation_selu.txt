Scaled Exponential Linear Unit (SELU).

The Scaled Exponential Linear Unit (SELU) activation function is defined as:

- `scale * x` if `x > 0`
- `scale * alpha * (exp(x) - 1)` if `x < 0`

where `alpha` and `scale` are pre-defined constants
(`alpha=1.67326324` and `scale=1.05070098`).

Basically, the SELU activation function multiplies `scale` (> 1) with the
output of the `keras.activations.elu` function to ensure a slope larger
than one for positive inputs.

The values of `alpha` and `scale` are
chosen so that the mean and variance of the inputs are preserved
between two consecutive layers as long as the weights are initialized
correctly (see `keras.initializers.LecunNormal` initializer)
and the number of input units is "large enough"
(see reference paper for more information).

Args:
    x: Input tensor.

Notes:

- To be used together with the
    `keras.initializers.LecunNormal` initializer.
- To be used together with the dropout variant
    `keras.layers.AlphaDropout` (rather than regular dropout).
