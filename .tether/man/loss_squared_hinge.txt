Help on class SquaredHinge in module keras.src.losses.losses:

class SquaredHinge(LossFunctionWrapper)
 |  SquaredHinge(reduction='sum_over_batch_size', name='squared_hinge')
 |
 |  Computes the squared hinge loss between `y_true` & `y_pred`.
 |
 |  Formula:
 |
 |  ```python
 |  loss = square(maximum(1 - y_true * y_pred, 0))
 |  ```
 |
 |  `y_true` values are expected to be -1 or 1. If binary (0 or 1) labels are
 |  provided we will convert them to -1 or 1.
 |
 |  Args:
 |      reduction: Type of reduction to apply to the loss. In almost all cases
 |          this should be `"sum_over_batch_size"`.
 |          Supported options are `"sum"`, `"sum_over_batch_size"` or `None`.
 |      name: Optional name for the loss instance.
