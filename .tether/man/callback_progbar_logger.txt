Help on class ProgbarLogger in module keras.src.callbacks.progbar_logger:

class ProgbarLogger(keras.src.callbacks.callback.Callback)
 |  Callback that prints metrics to stdout.
 |
 |  Args:
 |      count_mode: One of `"steps"` or `"samples"`.
 |          Whether the progress bar should
 |          count samples seen or steps (batches) seen.
 |
 |  Raises:
 |      ValueError: In case of invalid `count_mode`.

 |  Methods defined here:
 |
 |  __init__(self)
 |      Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
 |
 |  on_epoch_begin(
 |    self,
 |    epoch,
 |    logs=None
 |  )
 |      Called at the start of an epoch.
 |
 |      Subclasses should override for any actions to run. This function should
 |      only be called during TRAIN mode.
 |
 |      Args:
 |          epoch: Integer, index of epoch.
 |          logs: Dict. Currently no data is passed to this argument for this
 |            method but that may change in the future.
 |
 |  on_epoch_end(
 |    self,
 |    epoch,
 |    logs=None
 |  )
 |      Called at the end of an epoch.
 |
 |      Subclasses should override for any actions to run. This function should
 |      only be called during TRAIN mode.
 |
 |      Args:
 |          epoch: Integer, index of epoch.
 |          logs: Dict, metric results for this training epoch, and for the
 |            validation epoch if validation is performed. Validation result
 |            keys are prefixed with `val_`. For training epoch, the values of
 |            the `Model`'s metrics are returned. Example:
 |            `{'loss': 0.2, 'accuracy': 0.7}`.
 |
 |  on_predict_batch_end(
 |    self,
 |    batch,
 |    logs=None
 |  )
 |      Called at the end of a batch in `predict` methods.
 |
 |      Subclasses should override for any actions to run.
 |
 |      Note that if the `steps_per_execution` argument to `compile` in
 |      `Model` is set to `N`, this method will only be called every
 |      `N` batches.
 |
 |      Args:
 |          batch: Integer, index of batch within the current epoch.
 |          logs: Dict. Aggregated metric results up until this batch.
 |
 |  on_predict_begin(self, logs=None)
 |      Called at the beginning of prediction.
 |
 |      Subclasses should override for any actions to run.
 |
 |      Args:
 |          logs: Dict. Currently no data is passed to this argument for this
 |            method but that may change in the future.
 |
 |  on_predict_end(self, logs=None)
 |      Called at the end of prediction.
 |
 |      Subclasses should override for any actions to run.
 |
 |      Args:
 |          logs: Dict. Currently no data is passed to this argument for this
 |            method but that may change in the future.
 |
 |  on_test_batch_end(
 |    self,
 |    batch,
 |    logs=None
 |  )
 |      Called at the end of a batch in `evaluate` methods.
 |
 |      Also called at the end of a validation batch in the `fit`
 |      methods, if validation data is provided.
 |
 |      Subclasses should override for any actions to run.
 |
 |      Note that if the `steps_per_execution` argument to `compile` in
 |      `Model` is set to `N`, this method will only be called every
 |      `N` batches.
 |
 |      Args:
 |          batch: Integer, index of batch within the current epoch.
 |          logs: Dict. Aggregated metric results up until this batch.
 |
 |  on_test_begin(self, logs=None)
 |      Called at the beginning of evaluation or validation.
 |
 |      Subclasses should override for any actions to run.
 |
 |      Args:
 |          logs: Dict. Currently no data is passed to this argument for this
 |            method but that may change in the future.
 |
 |  on_test_end(self, logs=None)
 |      Called at the end of evaluation or validation.
 |
 |      Subclasses should override for any actions to run.
 |
 |      Args:
 |          logs: Dict. Currently the output of the last call to
 |            `on_test_batch_end()` is passed to this argument for this method
 |            but that may change in the future.
 |
 |  on_train_batch_end(
 |    self,
 |    batch,
 |    logs=None
 |  )
 |      Called at the end of a training batch in `fit` methods.
 |
 |      Subclasses should override for any actions to run.
 |
 |      Note that if the `steps_per_execution` argument to `compile` in
 |      `Model` is set to `N`, this method will only be called every
 |      `N` batches.
 |
 |      Args:
 |          batch: Integer, index of batch within the current epoch.
 |          logs: Dict. Aggregated metric results up until this batch.
 |
 |  on_train_begin(self, logs=None)
 |      Called at the beginning of training.
 |
 |      Subclasses should override for any actions to run.
 |
 |      Args:
 |          logs: Dict. Currently no data is passed to this argument for this
