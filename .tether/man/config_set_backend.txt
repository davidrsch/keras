keras.config.set_backend(backend)
__doc__
Reload the backend (and the Keras package).

Example:

```python
keras.config.set_backend("jax")
```

⚠️ WARNING ⚠️: Using this function is dangerous and should be done
carefully. Changing the backend will **NOT** convert
the type of any already-instantiated objects.
Thus, any layers / tensors / etc. already created will no
longer be usable without errors. It is strongly recommended **not**
to keep around **any** Keras-originated objects instances created
before calling `set_backend()`.

This includes any function or class instance that uses any Keras
functionality. All such code needs to be re-executed after calling
`set_backend()`.
