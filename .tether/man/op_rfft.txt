Real-valued Fast Fourier Transform along the last axis of the input.

Computes the 1D Discrete Fourier Transform of a real-valued signal over the
inner-most dimension of input.

Since the Discrete Fourier Transform of a real-valued signal is
Hermitian-symmetric, RFFT only returns the `fft_length / 2 + 1` unique
components of the FFT: the zero-frequency term, followed by the
`fft_length / 2` positive-frequency terms.

Along the axis RFFT is computed on, if `fft_length` is smaller than the
corresponding dimension of the input, the dimension is cropped. If it is
larger, the dimension is padded with zeros.

Args:
    x: Input tensor.
    fft_length: An integer representing the number of the fft length. If not
        specified, it is inferred from the length of the last axis of `x`.
        Defaults to `None`.

Returns:
    A tuple containing two tensors - the real and imaginary parts of the
    output.

Examples:

>>> x = keras.ops.convert_to_tensor([0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])
>>> rfft(x)
(array([10.0, -2.5, -2.5]), array([0.0, 3.4409548, 0.81229924]))

>>> rfft(x, 3)
(array([3.0, -1.5]), array([0.0, 0.8660254]))
