__doc__
Returns the cross product of two (arrays of) vectors.

The cross product of `x1` and `x2` in R^3 is a vector
perpendicular to both `x1` and `x2`. If `x1` and `x2` are arrays of
vectors, the vectors are defined by the last axis of `x1` and `x2`
by default, and these axes can have dimensions 2 or 3.

Where the dimension of either `x1` or `x2` is 2, the third component of
the input vector is assumed to be zero and the cross product calculated
accordingly.

In cases where both input vectors have dimension 2, the z-component of
the cross product is returned.

Args:
    x1: Components of the first vector(s).
    x2: Components of the second vector(s).
    axisa: Axis of `x1` that defines the vector(s). Defaults to `-1`.
    axisb: Axis of `x2` that defines the vector(s). Defaults to `-1`.
    axisc: Axis of the result containing the cross product vector(s).
        Ignored if both input vectors have dimension 2, as the return is
        scalar. By default, the last axis.
    axis: If defined, the axis of `x1`, `x2` and the result that
        defines the vector(s) and cross product(s). Overrides `axisa`,
        `axisb` and `axisc`.

Note:
    Torch backend does not support two dimensional vectors, or the
    arguments `axisa`, `axisb` and `axisc`. Use `axis` instead.

Returns:
    Vector cross product(s).
