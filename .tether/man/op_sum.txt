)
__doc__
Sum of a tensor over the given axes.

Args:
    x: Input tensor.
    axis: Axis or axes along which the sum is computed. The default is to
        compute the sum of the flattened tensor.
    keepdims: If this is set to `True`, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one.

Returns:
    Output tensor containing the sum.
