keras.Model.quantize(self, mode)
__doc__
Quantize the weights of the model.

Note that the model must be built first before calling this method.
`quantize` will recursively call `quantize(mode)` in all layers and
will be skipped if the layer doesn't implement the function.

Args:
    mode: The mode of the quantization. Only 'int8' is supported at this
        time.
