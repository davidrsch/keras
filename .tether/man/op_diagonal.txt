__doc__
Return specified diagonals.

If `x` is 2-D, returns the diagonal of `x` with the given offset, i.e., the
collection of elements of the form `x[i, i+offset]`.

If `x` has more than two dimensions, the axes specified by `axis1`
and `axis2` are used to determine the 2-D sub-array whose diagonal
is returned.

The shape of the resulting array can be determined by removing `axis1`
and `axis2` and appending an index to the right equal to the size of
the resulting diagonals.

Args:
    x: Input tensor.
    offset: Offset of the diagonal from the main diagonal.
        Can be positive or negative. Defaults to `0`.(main diagonal).
    axis1: Axis to be used as the first axis of the 2-D sub-arrays.
        Defaults to `0`.(first axis).
    axis2: Axis to be used as the second axis of the 2-D sub-arrays.
        Defaults to `1` (second axis).

Returns:
    Tensor of diagonals.

Examples:
>>> from keras.src import ops
>>> x = ops.arange(4).reshape((2, 2))
>>> x
array([[0, 1],
       [2, 3]])
>>> x.diagonal()
array([0, 3])
>>> x.diagonal(1)
array([1])

>>> x = ops.arange(8).reshape((2, 2, 2))
>>> x
array([[[0, 1],
        [2, 3]],
       [[4, 5],
        [6, 7]]])
>>> x.diagonal(0, 0, 1)
array([[0, 6],
       [1, 7]])
