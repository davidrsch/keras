keras.utils.unpack_x_y_sample_weight(data)
__doc__
Unpacks user-provided data tuple.

This is a convenience utility to be used when overriding
`Model.train_step`, `Model.test_step`, or `Model.predict_step`.
This utility makes it easy to support data of the form `(x,)`,
`(x, y)`, or `(x, y, sample_weight)`.

Example:

>>> features_batch = ops.ones((10, 5))
>>> labels_batch = ops.zeros((10, 5))
>>> data = (features_batch, labels_batch)
>>> # `y` and `sample_weight` will default to `None` if not provided.
>>> x, y, sample_weight = unpack_x_y_sample_weight(data)
>>> sample_weight is None
True

Args:
    data: A tuple of the form `(x,)`, `(x, y)`, or `(x, y, sample_weight)`.

Returns:
    The unpacked tuple, with `None`s for `y` and `sample_weight` if they are
    not provided.
