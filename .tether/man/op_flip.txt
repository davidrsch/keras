keras.ops.flip(x, axis=None)
__doc__
Reverse the order of elements in the tensor along the given axis.

The shape of the tensor is preserved, but the elements are reordered.

Args:
    x: Input tensor.
    axis: Axis or axes along which to flip the tensor. The default,
        `axis=None`, will flip over all of the axes of the input tensor.

Returns:
    Output tensor with entries of `axis` reversed.
