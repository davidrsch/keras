Help on class MaxNorm in module keras.src.constraints.constraints:

class MaxNorm(Constraint)
 |  MaxNorm(max_value=2, axis=0)
 |
 |  MaxNorm weight constraint.
 |
 |  Constrains the weights incident to each hidden unit
 |  to have a norm less than or equal to a desired value.
 |
 |  Also available via the shortcut function `keras.constraints.max_norm`.
 |
 |  Args:
 |      max_value: the maximum norm value for the incoming weights.
 |      axis: integer, axis along which to calculate weight norms.
 |          For instance, in a `Dense` layer the weight matrix
 |          has shape `(input_dim, output_dim)`,
 |          set `axis` to `0` to constrain each weight vector
 |          of length `(input_dim,)`.
 |          In a `Conv2D` layer with `data_format="channels_last"`,
 |          the weight tensor has shape
 |          `(rows, cols, input_depth, output_depth)`,
 |          set `axis` to `[0, 1, 2]`
 |          to constrain the weights of each filter tensor of size
 |          `(rows, cols, input_depth)`.

 |  Methods defined here:
 |
 |  __call__(self, w)
 |      Applies the constraint to the input weight variable.
 |
 |      By default, the inputs weight variable is not modified.
 |      Users should override this method to implement their own projection
 |      function.
 |
 |      Args:
 |          w: Input weight variable.
 |
 |      Returns:
 |          Projected variable (by default, returns unmodified inputs).
 |
 |  __init__(
 |    self,
 |    max_value=2,
 |    axis=0
 |  )
 |      Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
 |
 |  get_config(self)
 |      Returns a Python dict of the object config.
 |
 |      A constraint config is a Python dictionary (JSON-serializable) that can
 |      be used to reinstantiate the same object.
 |
 |      Returns:
 |          Python dict containing the configuration of the constraint object.
