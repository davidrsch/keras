__doc__
Calculates the mean and variance of `x`.

The mean and variance are calculated by aggregating the contents of `x`
across `axes`. If `x` is 1-D and `axes = [0]` this is just the mean and
variance of a vector.

Args:
    x: Input tensor.
    axes: A list of axes which to compute mean and variance.
    keepdims: If this is set to `True`, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one.
    synchronized: Only applicable with the TensorFlow backend.
        If `True`, synchronizes the global batch statistics (mean and
        variance) across all devices at each training step in a
        distributed training strategy. If `False`, each replica uses its own
        local batch statistics.

Returns:
    A tuple containing two tensors - mean and variance.

Example:

>>> x = keras.ops.convert_to_tensor([0, 1, 2, 3, 100], dtype="float32")
>>> keras.ops.moments(x, axes=[0])
(array(21.2, dtype=float32), array(1553.3601, dtype=float32))
