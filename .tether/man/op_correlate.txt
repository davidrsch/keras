__doc__
Compute the cross-correlation of two 1-dimensional tensors.

Args:
    x1: First 1-dimensional input tensor of length M.
    x2: Second 1-dimensional input tensor of length N.
    mode: Either `valid`, `same` or `full`.
        By default the mode is set to `valid`, which returns
        an output of length max(M, N) - min(M, N) + 1.
        `same` returns an output of length max(M, N).
        `full` mode returns the convolution at each point of
        overlap, with an output length of N+M-1

Returns:
    Output tensor, cross-correlation of `x1` and `x2`.
