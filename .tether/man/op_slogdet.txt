__doc__
Compute the sign and natural logarithm of the determinant of a matrix.

Args:
    x: Input matrix. It must 2D and square.

Returns:
    A tuple `(sign, logabsdet)`. `sign` is a number representing
    the sign of the determinant. For a real matrix, this is 1, 0, or -1.
    For a complex matrix, this is a complex number with absolute value 1
    (i.e., it is on the unit circle), or else 0.
    `logabsdet` is the natural log of the absolute value of the determinant.
