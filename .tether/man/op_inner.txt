keras.ops.inner(x1, x2)
__doc__
Return the inner product of two tensors.

Ordinary inner product of vectors for 1-D tensors
(without complex conjugation), in higher dimensions
a sum product over the last axes.

Multidimensional arrays are treated as vectors by flattening
all but their last axes. The resulting dot product is performed
over their last axes.

Args:
    x1: First input tensor.
    x2: Second input tensor. The last dimension of `x1` and `x2`
        must match.

Returns:
    Output tensor. The shape of the output is determined by
    broadcasting the shapes of `x1` and `x2` after removing
    their last axes.
