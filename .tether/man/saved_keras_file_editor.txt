Help on class KerasFileEditor in module keras.src.saving.file_editor:

class KerasFileEditor(builtins.object)
 |  KerasFileEditor(filepath)
 |
 |  Utility to inspect, edit, and resave Keras weights files.
 |
 |  You will find this class useful when adapting
 |  an old saved weights file after having made
 |  architecture changes to a model.
 |
 |  Args:
 |      filepath: The path to a local file to inspect and edit.
 |
 |  Examples:
 |
 |  ```python
 |  editor = KerasFileEditor("my_model.weights.h5")
 |
 |  # Displays current contents
 |  editor.summary()
 |
 |  # Remove the weights of an existing layer
 |  editor.delete_object("layers/dense_2")
 |
 |  # Add the weights of a new layer
 |  editor.add_object("layers/einsum_dense", weights={"0": ..., "1": ...})
 |
 |  # Save the weights of the edited model
 |  editor.resave_weights("edited_model.weights.h5")
 |  ```
 |
 |  Methods defined here:
 |
 |  __init__(self, filepath)
 |      Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
 |
 |  add_object(
 |    self,
 |    object_path,
 |    weights
 |  )
 |      Add a new object to the file (e.g. a layer).
 |
 |      Args:
 |          object_path: String, full path of the
 |              object to add (e.g. `"layers/dense_2"`).
 |          weights: Dict mapping weight names to weight
 |              values (arrays),
 |              e.g. `{"0": kernel_value, "1": bias_value}`.
 |
 |  add_weights(
 |    self,
 |    object_name,
 |    weights
 |  )
 |      Add one or more new weights to an existing object.
 |
 |      Args:
 |          object_name: String, name or path of the
 |              object to add the weights to
 |              (e.g. `"dense_2"` or `"layers/dense_2"`).
 |          weights: Dict mapping weight names to weight
 |              values (arrays),
 |              e.g. `{"0": kernel_value, "1": bias_value}`.
 |
 |  compare(self, reference_model)
 |      Compares the opened file to a reference model.
 |
 |      This method will list all mismatches between the
 |      currently opened file and the provided reference model.
 |
 |      Args:
 |          reference_model: Model instance to compare to.
 |
 |      Returns:
 |          Dict with the following keys:
 |          `'status'`, `'error_count'`, `'match_count'`.
 |          Status can be `'success'` or `'error'`.
 |          `'error_count'` is the number of mismatches found.
 |          `'match_count'` is the number of matching weights found.
 |
 |  delete_object(self, object_name)
 |      Removes an object from the file (e.g. a layer).
 |
 |      Args:
 |          object_name: String, name or path of the
 |              object to delete (e.g. `"dense_2"` or
 |              `"layers/dense_2"`).
 |
 |  delete_weight(
 |    self,
 |    object_name,
 |    weight_name
 |  )
 |      Removes a weight from an existing object.
 |
 |      Args:
 |          object_name: String, name or path of the
 |              object from which to remove the weight
 |              (e.g. `"dense_2"` or `"layers/dense_2"`).
 |          weight_name: String, name of the weight to
 |              delete (e.g. `"0"`).
 |
 |  rename_object(
 |    self,
 |    object_name,
 |    new_name
 |  )
 |      Rename an object in the file (e.g. a layer).
 |
 |      Args:
 |          object_name: String, name or path of the
 |              object to rename (e.g. `"dense_2"` or
 |              `"layers/dense_2"`).
 |          new_name: String, new name of the object.
 |
 |  resave_weights(self, filepath)
 |
 |  save(self, filepath)
 |      Save the edited weights file.
 |
 |      Args:
 |          filepath: Path to save the file to.
 |              Must be a `.weights.h5` file.
 |
 |  summary(self)
 |      Prints the weight structure of the opened file.
