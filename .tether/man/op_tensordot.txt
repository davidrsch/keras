)
__doc__
Compute the tensor dot product along specified axes.

Args:
    x1: First tensor.
    x2: Second tensor.
    axes: - If an integer, N, sum over the last N axes of `x1` and the
            first N axes of `x2` in order. The sizes of the corresponding
            axes must match.
          - Or, a list of axes to be summed over, first sequence applying
            to `x1`, second to `x2`. Both sequences must be of the
            same length.

Returns:
    The tensor dot product of the inputs.
