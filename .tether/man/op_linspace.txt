__doc__
Return evenly spaced numbers over a specified interval.

Returns `num` evenly spaced samples, calculated over the interval
`[start, stop]`.

The endpoint of the interval can optionally be excluded.

Args:
    start: The starting value of the sequence.
    stop: The end value of the sequence, unless `endpoint` is set to
        `False`. In that case, the sequence consists of all but the last
        of `num + 1` evenly spaced samples, so that `stop` is excluded.
        Note that the step size changes when `endpoint` is `False`.
    num: Number of samples to generate. Defaults to `50`. Must be
        non-negative.
    endpoint: If `True`, `stop` is the last sample. Otherwise, it is
        not included. Defaults to `True`.
    retstep: If `True`, return `(samples, step)`, where `step` is the
        spacing between samples.
    dtype: The type of the output tensor.
    axis: The axis in the result to store the samples. Relevant only if
        start or stop are array-like. Defaults to `0`.

Note:
    Torch backend does not support `axis` argument.

Returns:
    A tensor of evenly spaced numbers.
    If `retstep` is `True`, returns `(samples, step)`
