class Adafactor(keras.src.optimizers.optimizer.Optimizer)
 |  Adafactor(learning_rate=0.001, beta_2_decay=-0.8, epsilon_1=1e-30, epsilon_2=0.001, clip_threshold=1.0, relative_step=True, weight_decay=None, clipnorm=None, clipvalue=None, global_clipnorm=None, use_ema=False, ema_momentum=0.99, ema_overwrite_frequency=None, loss_scale_factor=None, gradient_accumulation_steps=None, name='adafactor', **kwargs)
 |
 |  Optimizer that implements the Adafactor algorithm.
 |
 |  Adafactor is commonly used in NLP tasks, and has the advantage
 |  of taking less memory because it only saves partial information of previous
 |  gradients.
 |
 |  The default argument setup is based on the original paper (see reference).
 |  When gradients are of dimension > 2, Adafactor optimizer will delete the
 |  last 2 dimensions separately in its accumulator variables.
 |
 |  Args:
 |      learning_rate: A float, a
 |          `keras.optimizers.schedules.LearningRateSchedule` instance, or
 |          a callable that takes no arguments and returns the actual value to
 |          use. The learning rate. Defaults to `0.001`.
 |      beta_2_decay: float, defaults to -0.8. The decay rate of `beta_2`.
 |      epsilon_1: float, defaults to 1e-30. A small offset to keep denominator
 |          away from 0.
 |      epsilon_2: float, defaults to 1e-3. A small offset to avoid learning
 |          rate becoming too small by time.
 |      clip_threshold: float, defaults to 1.0. Clipping threshold. This is a
 |          part of Adafactor algorithm, independent from `clipnorm`,
 |          `clipvalue`, and `global_clipnorm`.
 |      relative_step: bool, defaults to `True`. If `learning_rate` is a
 |          constant and `relative_step=True`, learning rate will be adjusted
 |          based on current iterations. This is a default learning rate decay
 |          in Adafactor.
 |      name: String. The name to use
 |          for momentum accumulator weights created by
 |          the optimizer.
 |      weight_decay: Float. If set, weight decay is applied.
 |      clipnorm: Float. If set, the gradient of each weight is individually
 |          clipped so that its norm is no higher than this value.
 |      clipvalue: Float. If set, the gradient of each weight is clipped to be
 |          no higher than this value.
 |      global_clipnorm: Float. If set, the gradient of all weights is clipped
 |          so that their global norm is no higher than this value.
 |      use_ema: Boolean, defaults to `False`.
 |          If `True`, exponential moving average
 |          (EMA) is applied. EMA consists of computing an exponential moving
 |          average of the weights of the model (as the weight values change
 |          after each training batch), and periodically overwriting the
 |          weights with their moving average.
 |      ema_momentum: Float, defaults to 0.99. Only used if `use_ema=True`.
 |          This is the momentum to use when computing
 |          the EMA of the model's weights:
 |          `new_average = ema_momentum * old_average + (1 - ema_momentum) *
 |          current_variable_value`.
 |      ema_overwrite_frequency: Int or None, defaults to None. Only used if
 |          `use_ema=True`. Every `ema_overwrite_frequency` steps of iterations,
 |          we overwrite the model variable by its moving average.
 |          If None, the optimizer
 |          does not overwrite model variables in the middle of training,
 |          and you need to explicitly overwrite the variables
 |          at the end of training by calling
 |          `optimizer.finalize_variable_values()` (which updates the model
 |          variables in-place). When using the built-in `fit()` training loop,
 |          this happens automatically after the last epoch,
 |          and you don't need to do anything.
 |      loss_scale_factor: Float or `None`. If a float, the scale factor will
 |          be multiplied the loss before computing gradients, and the inverse
 |          of the scale factor will be multiplied by the gradients before
 |          updating variables. Useful for preventing underflow during
 |          mixed precision training. Alternately,
 |          `keras.optimizers.LossScaleOptimizer` will
 |          automatically set a loss scale factor.
 |      gradient_accumulation_steps: Int or `None`. If an int, model & optimizer
 |          variables will not be updated at every step; instead they will be
 |          updated every `gradient_accumulation_steps` steps, using the average
 |          value of the gradients since the last update. This is known as
 |          "gradient accumulation". This can be useful
 |          when your batch size is very small, in order to reduce gradient
 |          noise at each update step.
