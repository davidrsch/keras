Help on class NonNeg in module keras.src.constraints.constraints:

class NonNeg(Constraint)
 |  Constrains the weights to be non-negative.
 |
 |  Method resolution order:
 |      NonNeg
 |      Constraint
 |      builtins.object
 |
 |  Methods defined here:
 |
 |  __call__(self, w)
 |      Applies the constraint to the input weight variable.
 |
 |      By default, the inputs weight variable is not modified.
 |      Users should override this method to implement their own projection
 |      function.
 |
 |      Args:
 |          w: Input weight variable.
 |
 |      Returns:
 |          Projected variable (by default, returns unmodified inputs).
