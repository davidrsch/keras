Help on class RandomSharpness in module keras.src.layers.preprocessing.image_preprocessing.random_sharpness:

class RandomSharpness(keras.src.layers.preprocessing.image_preprocessing.base_image_preprocessing_layer.BaseImagePreprocessingLayer)
 |  RandomSharpness(factor, value_range=(0, 255), data_format=None, seed=None, **kwargs)
 |
 |  Randomly performs the sharpness operation on given images.
 |
 |  The sharpness operation first performs a blur, then blends between the
 |  original image and the processed image. This operation adjusts the clarity
 |  of the edges in an image, ranging from blurred to enhanced sharpness.
 |
 |  Args:
 |      factor: A tuple of two floats or a single float.
 |          `factor` controls the extent to which the image sharpness
 |          is impacted. `factor=0.0` results in a fully blurred image,
 |          `factor=0.5` applies no operation (preserving the original image),
 |          and `factor=1.0` enhances the sharpness beyond the original. Values
 |          should be between `0.0` and `1.0`. If a tuple is used, a `factor`
 |          is sampled between the two values for every image augmented.
 |          If a single float is used, a value between `0.0` and the passed
 |          float is sampled. To ensure the value is always the same,
 |          pass a tuple with two identical floats: `(0.5, 0.5)`.
 |      value_range: the range of values the incoming images will have.
 |          Represented as a two-number tuple written `[low, high]`. This is
 |          typically either `[0, 1]` or `[0, 255]` depending on how your
 |          preprocessing pipeline is set up.
 |      seed: Integer. Used to create a random seed.
