class CutMix(keras.src.layers.preprocessing.image_preprocessing.base_image_preprocessing_layer.BaseImagePreprocessingLayer)
 |  CutMix(factor=1.0, seed=None, data_format=None, **kwargs)
 |
 |  CutMix data augmentation technique.
 |
 |  CutMix is a data augmentation method where patches are cut and pasted
 |  between two images in the dataset, while the labels are also mixed
 |  proportionally to the area of the patches.
 |
 |  Args:
 |      factor: A single float or a tuple of two floats between 0 and 1.
 |          If a tuple of numbers is passed, a `factor` is sampled
 |          between the two values.
 |          If a single float is passed, a value between 0 and the passed
 |          float is sampled. These values define the range from which the
 |          mixing weight is sampled. A higher factor increases the variability
 |          in patch sizes, leading to more diverse and larger mixed patches.
 |          Defaults to 1.
 |      seed: Integer. Used to create a random seed.
