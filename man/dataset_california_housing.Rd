}
\arguments{
\item{version}{\code{"small"} or \code{"large"}. The small version
contains 600 samples, the large version contains
20,640 samples. The purpose of the small version is
to serve as an approximate replacement for the
deprecated \code{boston_housing} dataset.}

\item{path}{path where to cache the dataset locally
(relative to \code{Sys.getenv("KERAS_HOME")}).}

\item{test_split}{fraction of the data to reserve as test set.}

\item{seed}{Random seed for shuffling the data
before computing the test split.}
}
\value{
Nested list of arrays: \verb{(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test)}.

\strong{\code{x_train}, \code{x_test}}: arrays with shape \verb{(num_samples, 8)}
containing either the training samples (for \code{x_train}),
or test samples (for \code{y_train}).

\strong{\code{y_train}, \code{y_test}}: arrays of shape \verb{(num_samples,)}
containing the target scalars. The targets are float scalars
typically between 25,000 and 500,000 that represent
the home prices in dollars.

\description{
This dataset was obtained from the \href{https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~ltorgo/Regression/cal_housing.html}{StatLib repository}.

It's a continuous regression dataset with 20,640 samples with
8 features each.

The target variable is a scalar: the median house value
for California districts, in dollars.

The 8 input features are the following:
\itemize{
\item MedInc: median income in block group
\item HouseAge: median house age in block group
\item AveRooms: average number of rooms per household
\item AveBedrms: average number of bedrooms per household
\item Population: block group population
\item AveOccup: average number of household members
\item Latitude: block group latitude
\item Longitude: block group longitude
}

This dataset was derived from the 1990 U.S. census, using one row
per census block group. A block group is the smallest geographical
unit for which the U.S. Census Bureau publishes sample data
(a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people).

A household is a group of people residing within a home.
Since the average number of rooms and bedrooms in this dataset are
provided per household, these columns may take surprisingly large
values for block groups with few households and many empty houses,
such as vacation resorts.
